# FoodDAO

# Crypto-Bridge

I must credit Alexander John Lee for this project. I learned how to build this DAO from his [repo](https://github.com/partylikeits1983/simpleDAO).

This project showcases how a typical crypto DAO works.

## What is this project all about?

As we know it in Web3, a DAO is an association of people who use blockchain as a touchpoint. So the DAO in the instant case are raising money to buy food for humanitarian reasons. The amount of food they need to buy is worth 1 Ether. So the money is complete, a contract will automatically buy it.

But before then, the admin of the DAO will have to approve those who can vote to ascertain their memberships. After voting, they can withdraw the funds and check the balance.

I made sure I documented the code well, so you can read and code along. If you encounter any problem, come talk to me on Twitter.

## What I learned in this project

Well, these are the few things I learned:

1. Relevance and Applicability of "Weight" in Solidity

If you check the `approveVoting` function, we had to use `voters[voter].weight = 1` to assign credibility to each voter. I have known about dot weight before, but this project strengthened my understanding

2. For Loops

I wrote a couple of loop programs in this project, which made me more familiar with various places I can use `for loop` as a developer.

## Hire me for freelance technical writing jobs!

Anyone who has followed my journey so far will understand I've been working aggressively on my development skill, even though I am a senior technical writer. I can craft high-quality technical content for your Web3 company due to my wealth of experience.
